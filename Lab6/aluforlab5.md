## A. Part

## 1 bit ALU where was doing these:

* Addition => 00
* Removal => 01
* OR => 10
* AND => 11

The design of the logic unit requires an OR gate and an AND gate whose outputs are fed to a 2x1 multiplexer which when op0 is 0 passes the OR and 1 passes the AND.

The final schematic of the 1-bit ALU was designed in the DSCH program.
